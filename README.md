# Othello
Digital version of the board game Othello

Requires modules: copy, random

You can play against the computer (with random moves or the most aggressive moves available chosen), or against another player.

The aggressive move decision making is non-deterministic, so the computer may choose a different move if there are multiple equally
"aggressive" moves available.

Enable show available tiles during game setup to have available moves displayed as an 'A' on the gameboard

Currently under development: A more difficult AI algorithm to make the game more challenging using a MiniMax algorithm with alpha
beta pruning.
